Hosting
=======

The web-app is hostet on EU-Pythonanywhere: 

`www.wattwerkstatt-stromhausfall.eu.pythonanywhere.com <http://wattwerkstatt-stromhausfall.eu.pythonanywhere.com/>`_.

The databases are hosted there as normal files in the file system, there is no dedicated SQL-Hosting active.

``As of June 2023``

.. note:: The root path has to be adjusted for pythonanywhere. In several files this is possible by uncommenting the prepared line at the beginning. For running the app locally in an IDE the root path has to be empty (''). For pythonanywhere it is currently set as '/home/stromhausfall/mysite/'.
