Application
===========

This is the detailed code reference for the *WattWerkstatt* project. It contains all modules and functions with their descriptions, inputs and outputs.

The file ``application.py`` is the application entry point. Here, the dash app object and server are defined,
the callbacks are included and the app is started.


Detailed information on the structure and functions of the app itself can be found in the corresponding thesis (in German |github-icon| `Github`_).

The layout of the app is created in the :ref:`Layout section <target_layout>`.

All actions caused by the user are defined in the :ref:`Callbacks <target_callbacks>`

The callbacks and other files use external :ref:`Modules <target_modules>`.

All relevant data and profiles are stored in :ref:`Databases <target_databases>`.
