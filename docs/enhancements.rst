Enhancements and Ideas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Idea", "Category", "Description"

   "Undo button", "Functionality", "An undo-button would be a great addition to the functionality."
   "Device integration", "Household Devices", "Not enough devices included. Especially devices used by the target group are interesting."
   "Device classification", "Household Devices", "Would be great to be able to differentiate better between older and newer devices (e.g. washing machine, efficiency classes)."
   "Power profile scaling", "Household Devices", "Make profiles scalable (e.g. take a 100W PC power profile and scale it to a 200W PC)."
   "Explanation of time slider", "User expericence", "The time slider for the grid is not introduced properly, it is not intuitive to use it."
   "Line mode activation", "User experience", "It is not comfortable to deactivate the line mode after each use."
   "Symbol external grid", "User experience", "The external grid symbol does not represent the function well and is not intuitive to understand."
   "Icon own device", "User experience", "Copying from iconify is not comfortable enough, maybe implement a pre-selection of icons?"
   "Transformer", "Knowledge", "The user does not necessarily know what a transformer does exactly."
   "Layout scaling", "Layout", "The layout does not scale with the screen size. Half-Windows are not possible because icons dissapear."
